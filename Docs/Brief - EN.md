# Helm — Product Brief

## In one sentence

A personal project management system with built-in AI, designed for brains that get easily distracted.

---

## The problem

- I start projects, produce a lot, then lose track of the "why" and "where to"
- I don't know how to break down my ideas into concrete tasks
- Existing tools are either too simple (task lists) or too complex (bloated software)
- No tool accounts for my ADHD brain: need for clarity, focus, and continuity

---

## The solution

A project copilot — not just a task tool, but a system that helps me **think**, **break down**, and **stay on track**.

AI is not a feature. It's the foundation. The tool *is* a copilot that uses lists, canvas, and views as interfaces.

---

## For whom

Me. Personal use only. No collaboration, no sharing, not for sale.

Profile: ADHD, multi-project (work + personal), needs structured guidance, tendency to hyperfocus then abandon.

---

## Pillars

| Pillar | What it means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Clarity** | Always know where I am, what's the next action, why I'm doing this |
| **Assisted structure** | The tool helps me break down, not just store tasks |
| **Focus** | See only what matters now, not the entire backlog |
| **Continuity** | Pick up exactly where I left off, without friction |
| **Integrated reflection** | Canvas, AI, spaces to think — not just execute |

---

## AI as copilot

AI intervenes at every stage of the project lifecycle:

| Moment | What the copilot does |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Project creation** | Asks the right questions, helps formulate "Done", suggests initial breakdown |
| **When I'm lost** | "You've been working on X for 3 days. Here's where you are. I suggest..." |
| **Note-taking** | Understands context, links to existing tasks, extracts actions |
| **Canvas** | Can summarize a canvas into tasks, or generate a canvas from a project |
| **Daily opening** | "Yesterday you did X. Today, I suggest focusing on Y. Here's why." |
| **When I disengage** | Detects inactivity, gently re-engages with a summary and simple entry point |
| **Review** | "This week: 12 tasks completed, 2 projects advanced. What's blocking: Z." |

## Features

### MVP (Phase 1)

- [ ] **Inbox / Quick capture** — Global shortcut to capture an idea in 2 seconds
- [ ] **Structured projects** — Each project must have: name, "Why", "Done"
- [ ] **Project kickoff wizard** — AI guides creation: what is it? why? what's "done"? first action?
- [ ] **List view** — Tasks with infinite subtasks
- [ ] **Kanban view** — Basic columns (To do, In progress, Done)
- [ ] **Focus mode** — Shows only the next action
- [ ] **Summary on open** — "Here's where you are" generated by AI
- [ ] **Contexts** — Work / Personal separation
- [ ] **Global search**

### Phase 2

- [ ] **Canvas** — Free visual view, attachable to projects
- [ ] **Conversational AI** — Challenge my ideas, help break down, answer "where am I on X?"
- [ ] **Linked notes** — Take notes in a project, AI extracts actions
- [ ] **Weekly review** — Summary of what was accomplished, what's blocking
- [ ] **WIP limit** — Maximum X tasks "in progress" simultaneously
- [ ] **Daily planning** — Morning ritual: what's realistic today?

### Phase 3 (Later)

- [ ] Integrated Pomodoro
- [ ] Visual themes
- [ ] Calendar view
- [ ] Inactivity detection + gentle nudge

## UX Principles

- **Minimal friction** to capture an idea
- **Intentional friction** to create a new project (avoid 50 empty projects)
- **"Why" always visible** when I'm deep in subtasks
- **No visual overwhelm** — clean, minimal, few elements on screen
- **No useless features** — no assignees, no collaboration, no complex time tracking

---

## What Helm is NOT

- A collaboration / team tool
- A product to sell
- Bloated software with 100 features
- A simple task manager
- A Notion/Asana/ClickUp clone

---

## Tech stack

*To be defined — this document is functional, not technical.*

---

## Open questions

- How to handle data persistence? (local first? cloud?)
- Which AI to use? (Claude API? local?)
- Desktop app? Web app? Both?
- How to visually represent a project's "clarity level"?
